Part _1_:

Meet Mage

MAGE:
Ah, there you are.
I wanted to meet you.
My sources tell me that Nexus was spotted in Derkaan.

YOU:
Isn't Derkaan off-limits?

MAGE:
Hence, the discretion.
At the headquarters, we are in the process of building synthesis chambers.
In fact, we have completed one of the many chambers.
As you know, we are not known for our combat capabilities.
These chambers will fulfill those needs for us.

YOU:
Why do you need me again?

MAGE:
On this island, you are the only one who specializes in neural devices.
I want you to help us control the warriors that are synthesized.

YOU:
You want to go face-to-face with Nexus and his army?
It's suicide.

MAGE:
These warriors are no ordinary ones.
These are specifically built to counter Nexus and the Derkaan army.
I know that his army is extraordinarily powerful, but trust me, these warriors will come in handy.

YOU:
I see.
Have you conducted any field tests yet?

MAGE:
That is the other reason why I wanted to see you.
I need you to go to the outskirts of Derkaan for a test run.

YOU:
If I don't come back in a day, know that it means I'm dead.

MAGE:
Well, in that case, I wish you luck. You won't need it.

PART _2_:

MAGE:
You're late.
I assumed you knew your way around HQ.

YOU:
Well, it's been a while.

MAGE:
And, I assume Tork doesn't know of this.

YOU:
No, he doesn't.

MAGE:
Very well.
Here is the test warrior you asked for.
You can keep it.

YOU:
Well, that's very polite of you.

MAGE:
Dmitri will meet you at the border.
Stay safe.

YOU:
Will do.

'SAM' HAS BEEN ADDED TO YOUR ROSTER!

PART _3_:

YOU GO TO THE BORDER

PART _4_:

DMITRI:
Where are you headed for?

YOU:
Derkaan.

DMITRI:
*laughs*
Mage sent you here, didn't she?

YOU:
It's not like I had a choice.

DMITRI:
You're kidding.
Boy, you don't know what you've gotten yourself into.

YOU:
If I don't return in a day, you'll come for me, right?

DMITRI:
Derkaan is off-limits.
You're on your own.
Nobody is going to come for you.

YOU:
Thanks for that.
Makes me feel safer already.

DMITRI:
Before heading out there, you might want to take a look at that warrior of yours.
Maybe give it a little upgrade, yeah?
He wouldn't even be able to take out one soldier.

YOU:
Upgrade?
What do you mean 'upgrade'?

DMITRI:
You know what, maybe another time.
Come back and I'll show you.
I wouldn't be surprised if you died out there.

YOU:
Great, I'll see you at dinner.

DMITRI:
Us border patrols don't 'dinner'.

END

PART _4_:

DMITRI:
So, how did it go?

YOU:
Well, I survived.

DMITRI:
That's great. Here, have some food.

YOU:
Thought you don't 'dinner'.

DMITRI:
Alright, more for me I guess.

YOU:
I didn't say no.

DMITRI:
Careful, it's hot.

YOU:
Yeah, I got it.
So, I remember you saying something about an upgrade.
What did you mean by that?

DMITRI:
I heard that these warriors can be enhanced.

EARN POINTS TO ENHANCE YOUR WARRIORS.
USE RUNES TO RANK THEM UP.

GO TO CHARACTER MENU AND UPGRADE YO WARRIOR.

PART _5_

MAGE:
I am assuming that the test run went well considering that
you are here alive.

YOU:
Went better than I thought.

MAGE:
We need those battle plans.

YOU:
Straight to the point, eh?

MAGE:
You need to steal those plans from the battle hall that's deep
in Nexus' fortress.

YOU:
And I get in there how?

MAGE:
You fight your way through.

YOU:
I just learnt how to use a warrior and now you want me to
fight my way through an army?

MAGE:
Is that a no then?

YOU:
Do I have a choice?

MAGE:
Very well. Dmitri will lead you to the border.
